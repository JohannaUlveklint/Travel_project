WHAT´S __INIT__ FOR ME?

UP NEXT:
* Check for rush hour parameters at openrouteservice.org, if not: how can I compensate for it? 50 km/h in densely
  built-up areas and 70 km/h in non-densely built-up areas in Gothenburg.

  Long term general traffic speeds in London are measured for central, inner and outer London using GPS-based data for
  key roads. Weekday (07:00 to 19:00) speeds from 2008 to 2018 have changed from:

  8.7 mph to 7.1 mph in central London 7.1 mph = 11.4 km/h
  12.5 mph to 11.6 mph in inner London 11.6 mph = 18.6 km/h
  20.3 mph to 19.3 mph in outer London 19.3 mph = 31.1 km/h
* Add time for looking for parking and change of clothes to total time.
* Make a function that compares the duration for the different vehicles.
* Update run().
* Check what functions to delete.
* Make an example user with logged trips.
* Start with the diagrams.
* Can I use a map?
* Can the user choose between addresses when typing?
* Make unittests.

PRACTICALITIES:
* UML
* gitignore?
* Make a user


PARAMETERS
* Heart rate increase, uphill
* Expected life span everyday exercise lifestyle vs sedentary lifestyle
* Perspiration indicator, stress :)
* Time:
  - moving to and from vehicle
  - find a parking lot, distance from location
  - change of clothes
* Different speeds depending on type of cycling
* Traffic lights
* Rush hour traffic, time of day
* Parking lot data
* Weather conditions
* City/countryside templates

UI
* Choose between different cities with different topography
* Match case for calc trip, log trip or search x
* Print function for logged_trips

GAMIFICATION
* How number of cycling days impacts the life span expectancy
* How number of cycling days reduces CO2 emissions, compare with "if you´re really into apples you could eat ..."
* Show with diagrams
* Compare data on week to week-basis
* Try to break records
* Achieve the 150 minutes of physical activity
* Track records on certain distances (Strava)
* Log distances and time
* "Since you did this trip by bike you have saved x.xx co2 equivalents! If you are really into apples it is equal to
  consume x kg of apples!"

IN THE FUTURE
* Use coordinates/Google Maps/What3Words API to calculate distance
* Make a web solution
