WHAT´S __INIT__ FOR ME?

PRACTICALITIES:
* UML
* gitignore?


PARAMETERS
* Heart rate increase, uphill
* Expected life span everyday exercise lifestyle vs sedentary lifestyle
* Perspiration indicator, stress :)
* Time:
  - moving to and from vehicle
  - find a parking lot, distance from location
  - change of clothes
* Different speeds depending on type of cycling
* Traffic lights
* Rush hour traffic, time of day
* Parking lot data
* Weather conditions
* City/countryside templates

UI
* Choose between different cities with different topography

GAMIFICATION
* How number of cycling days impacts the life span expectancy
* How number of cycling days reduces CO2 emissions, compare with "if you´re really into apples you could eat ..."
* Show with diagrams
* Compare data on week to week-basis
* Try to break records
* Achieve the 150 minutes of physical activity
