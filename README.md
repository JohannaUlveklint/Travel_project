# Travel_project
The world needs change to keep up with the Paris agreement. On an individual level transporting is one way to contribute to the change. This travel project aims to make the user
see that several trips by car can instead be made by bike without that much time loss but that it indeed also comes with gains for the individual itself.

In this application you can search trips and get information about distance and duration for the trip made by car, regular bike and electric bike. You can also log and print trips 
and see statistics.
